# TrIM: Transformed Iterative Mondrian Forests for Gradient-based Dimension Reduction and High-Dimensional Regression

This is the official implementation of the TrIM algorithm, as described in the paper: [TrIM: Transformed Iterative Mondrian Forests for Gradient-based Dimension Reduction and High-Dimensional Regression]().

## Requirements
- Python 3.11
- JAX

To install JAX, please follow the instructions on the [JAX website](https://github.com/google/jax?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

To install the remaining required packages, run:
```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
